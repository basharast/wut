## Open Source?

I don't benefit from WUT at all, it's completely free and made to help others for real

In this wild world I have nothing to protect that and I saw many projects copied and sold in front of developers eyes

and they asked MS store for years to take these false copies down, but no luck and they ended with disappointment

I'm good and my well to help but also to protect your rights and mine too.

WUT as stated doesn't collect any usage data and it's completely safe

Many of my friends have access to the code as part of the transparency.

## About Commander (Scripts Engine):

Check out <a href="https://github.com/basharast/wut/wiki">GitHub Wiki</a>

Commander built to help anyone to create unlimited scripts for different purposes using GUI elements

The script structure is very simple.

You can mix between commander codes and batch script (Telnet required) to get more advanced usage

I tried to add commands as much as I can to make it more usable.

Commander can be used like Automate.

Checkout the documentation with the installation file for more details and demos.
