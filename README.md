## Open Source?

I don't benefit from WUT at all, it's completely free and made to help others for real

there are no plans for now to make the project opensource due to some considerations

this could change in future, but for now consider WUT as closed source project

if you have any concerns (which is perfectly fine and normal) please contact me.

However, parts of WUT already published for help and educational usage

## About Commander (Scripts Engine):

Check out <a href="https://github.com/basharast/wut/wiki">GitHub Wiki</a>

Commander built to help anyone to create unlimited scripts for different purposes using GUI elements

The script structure is very simple.

You can mix between commander codes and batch script (Telnet required) to get more advanced usage

I tried to add commands as much as I can to make it more usable.

Commander can be used like Automate.

Checkout the documentation with the installation file for more details and demos.
